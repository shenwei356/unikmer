	Long: fmt.Sprintf(`unikmer - Unique-Kmer Toolkit

A command-line toolkit providing functions including counting, format
convertion, set operations and searching of small k-mers (k <= 32)
optional with Taxids but without frequency information.

K-mers (k <= 32) are encoded into 'uint64', stored in builtin 'map' of
golang in RAM, and serialized in binary file with extension '.unik'.

Taxids can be assigned when counting k-mers from genome sequences,
and LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) will be computed during opertions
including computing union, intersecton, set difference, unique and
repeated k-mers.

Dataset (optional):

  Some commands need taxonomy file from e.g., NCBI Taxonomy database,
  please extract "nodes.dmp", "names.dmp", "delnodes.dmp" and "merged.dmp" 
  from link below into ~/.unikmer/ ,
  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz , 
  or some other directory, and later you can refer to using flag --data-dir,
  or environment variable UNIKMER_DB.

  For GTDB, use https://github.com/nick-youngblut/gtdb_to_taxdump 
  for taxonomy convertion.

  Note that Taxids are represented using uint32 and stored in 4 or less bytes,
  all taxids should be in range of [1, %d]
